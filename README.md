This project provides coding solutions for Assignment 1 of 7PAM2000 Applied Data Science 1. Examples of a multiple line plot, two pie charts, and a stacked bar chart are included in this solution. General functions are used to implement each visualisation technique.

The lineplot function will plot multiple lineplots in a single figure when respective data for  x and for variable number of ys are given. The headers of x and ys must be supplied as an input in the form of an array of strings.

When the corresponding array and labels are supplied, the pieplot function will generate a pie plot. The plot's year can also be used to construct the title.
