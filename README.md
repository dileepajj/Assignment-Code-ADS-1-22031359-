This project provides coding solutions for Assignment 1 of 7PAM2000 Applied Data Science 1. Examples of a multiple line plot, two pie charts, and a stacked bar chart are included in this solution. General functions are used to implement each visualisation technique.

The "lineplot" function will plot multiple lineplots in a single figure when respective data for  x and for variable number of ys are given. The headers of x and ys must be supplied as an input in the form of an array of strings.

When the corresponding array and labels are supplied, the "pieplot" function will generate a pie plot. The plot's year can also be used to construct the title.

"stacked_bar_plot" is another general function which is used to create a stacked bar plot according to the user specified number of bars.

The World Bank Open Data available at https://data.worldbank.org served as the basis for the csv files utilised in this work.
In order to compare South Asian countries with the UK, the GDP current (in US dollars), GDP per capita, and access to electricity of urban and rural population percentages were acquired from Global Development Indicators of the Word Bank Open Data.
